* = major bug fix

From 2.82
+ mapvote_next_limit: Value in seconds, restricts players from voting for a map at the very end of the match while still enabling mapvote_next features
+ New server cvar 'scoreboard' allows customizing fields of second scoreboard screen in team modes.
+ sv_idleremove: Value in seconds, removes player from their team if they reach this amount of total idle time. Set to 0 to disable, Teamplay modes only.

From 2.81
* 3team mode: third team can not be locked forever anymore
- Player can not flood sounds through menu
- Team scores reset at SpawnEntities, so you can use 'gamemap' command for resetting now.
- can't punch teammate anymore when ff is off
- Changing team/sub doesn't decrease frags when hit by teammate and round is over.
* Reloading HC with single barrel. Doesn't minus 2 when only the other shell is fired and you can now reload the last shell when you have only 1 left.
* Matchtime could left running if team is ready and all players is in sub.
- Getting frag when dead dont increase streak count.
- Cant drop anything when dead/spec, should fix issue when dropping weapon at same time you die caused 2 weapons to drop.
- Reports last damaged part as chest when hitted with knife while target was using kevlar west.
- Picking up m3/ssg didnt come with full clip when reloading.
+ radio/menu sounds use svc_sound instead of stuffing "play x.wav"
+ Moved some variables to own struct, so it makes code simpler/shorter.
+ Use direct path to show team skin pics instead of "../pics". This allows those pictures inside pak to work.
+ checking player skins for overflow
+ Made some buffers smaller and using buffer safe copying istead of using huge buffers to make sure all fits
+ removed "use_mapvote" & "use_cvote" from serverinfo. More space for other
+ roundtimeleft now also shows remaining seconds
+ time command now works in matchmode too
+ Doesnt update CS_PLAYERSKINS config string in teamplay when nick or skin havent changed.
+ second mode to Cvar use_mapvote 2, it's same as 1 except it changes to mostvoted map when timelimit/roundlimit hits.
+ "pausegame" command in matchmode. This allow non substitutes to pause game for 1min.
+ "unpausegame" to unpause (who would guess). Only players in same team which paused can unpause.
+ Cvar "mm_pausecount" to define how many times team can pause the game.  When "0" pause is disabled (Default "3").
+ Cvar "mm_pausetime" to define pause time in minutes (default 2)
+ New playing mode: Team Deathmatch with matchmode! Use 'teamdm 1' to enable.
+ Cvar teamdm_respawn to specify respawn time (default 4).
+ cmd 'resetscores' to reset scores in matchmode. The command can be used by matchadmins or captains. When captains are using it, it will need to be accepted by the other captain as well.
+ item_respawn, weapon_respawn & ammo_respawn cvars to define respawn time when dropped. defaults: item 59, weapon 74 & ammo 30.
+ Matchmode support for 3 team and ctf playing modes.
+ Cvar "respawn_effect" to enable effect+sound when respawning in dm/teamdm/ctf.
- Dropping bandolier in teamplay mode used deathmatch values for ammo, so it allowed to drop bandolier and still have some extra ammo.
- Fixed issues when radio death sound get played more than once.
- 'use throwing combat knife' and 'use slashing combat knife' did change the mode when it was the correct mode already.
* 3rd team in 3team mode wont allways spawn to same spot anymore.
+ Removed ALOT string compares for specifying model, instead added new integer for type. This should speed up little bit.
+ In ctf mode, team1 players will only use 'info_player_team1' spawns and team2 'info_player_team2' spawns. If map doesnt have these spawns, it uses random 'info_player_deathmatch' spawn like spectators.
+ cvar 'wave_time' to specify delay between each wave commands in seconds. Default 5
- 'time' command would only work in matchmode.
* Couple of bugs that caused crash.
- Score print at end of match when playing ctf would print 0's as both team scores.
+ Temporary vote banning uses same banning list like normal ban/teamkill bans, so admins can now remove/list them.
+ When temp banned (by teamkilling/vote kick), ban msg says temporary banned and how many games, instead of just "Banned".
+ ammo_respawn cvar also effects to grenade respawn time.
+ Changed CS_PLAYERSKINS update back for now.
+ Changed 'use throwing combat knife" toggle back, seems like some player are used how it was.
+ Disabled some commands when game is paused.
+ dmflags 65536 changes the weapon respawn method in teamd/dm. Now weapons keep respawnning even if weapon is in use. With this setting cvar 'weapon_respawn' controls the respawn time when picked, not dropped.
* Pistols didn't respawn at dm/teamdm.
- Votes now actually work in teamDM during play.
- Disabled config/map voting during intermission. Thus, a player could change map/cfg while mapchange.
* Crashed when client used this game-mod for demo playback.
- Now, it doesn't sound when you're zooming your ssg to same zoom-level using the lens command.
- Multiple lens command during bandage or too fast repeating could do extra annoying zooming.
* Player with last ID didnt show up in ignore menu.
- If you were killing a player only with one last kevlar shot the console message was sent to the player who hit him before.
+ Disabled 'Leave team' menu on non-teamplay mode.
+ Removed spaces from demo name using autorecord.
+ Changed skin _i.pcx pics back using '..' like they were. Client download code didnt like it, though it doesn't like '..' either.
+ Disabled '..' in voice command.
+ 'item_respawnmode' cvar to change how item respawns in dm/teamdm. Normally item would only spawn at random deathmatch spawn.  The new mode disables it and spawns item only if map has a spawn point for this item.
- Remove a few lines of code that broke compiling on Linux
+ Disable MM2 messages displayed as MM1 in DM
+ Disable leg damage sound when falling and fall damage disabled
+ New cvar "motdname" which tells which file to read the MOTD from
+ Better auto joining which calculates the correct team when you select "Auto-join team" from menu rather select the correct menu item for you
- Fixed all compiler warnings for gcc 4.8 with -Wall on Linux x86_64.
+ Added automatic detection of MinGW environment to Makefile.
- Chase camera no longer gets stuck up or down after in-eyes spectating someone who looks wildly up or down (usually bots).
- Center-handed weapon icon for in-eyes spectator now reflects your 'hand' setting rather than the person you're watching.
+ Added 'hud_team_icon', 'hud_item_cycle', and 'hud_noscore' to let server admins tweak the hud elements a bit.  Default teamplay HUD no longer has your frags.
- HUD elements like health and ammo no longer show up when free spectating.
+ Added 'allow_hoarding' to control whether players are allowed to carry multiple of the same unique weapon or special item (by default they can't anymore).
+ Added 'use_flashlight' option so server admin can decide to allow the flashlight in non-darkmatch.
- No more lasersight or splats on the sky.
- Splats and bulletholes now stick to moving objects.
+ Added 'bholelife', 'splatlife', 'shelllife', and 'shelllimit' to give server operators greater control over these effects.  Default values retain old behavior.
+ Teamplay scoreboard page 2 now shows team, kills, and deaths in all submodes.  Disabled 'use_newscore' by default because it's fairly redundant now.
- If you enable 'use_newscore', it can also show 3-team scores.
- Changed items names for "clips" to "magazines" and "machinegun" to "MP5".
+ Added 'sv slap' command.  Admins can use it to unstick players, or just for fun.  With great power comes great responsibility.
- Chat replacements (like %k) now work when dead too, and invalid options no longer attempt to resolve as printf replacements.
- Fixed some issues with "%" in voting printf statements.
- Clients no longer get additional map votes to spend when the map changes by other means.
+ Added 'force_skin' cvar if you want to make everyone look the same in non-teamplay modes.  Default empty (doesn't force skin).
+ Added 'silentwalk' cvar if you want strafing while walking to not generate footstep sounds.  Default off.
+ When you get hit by a thrown knife, it adds to your inventory.  Throw it back!  This also allows people to grab the murder weapon from your body.
+ Added 'sv_fps' support for servers that implement variable framerate.  Multiple of 10; higher values reduce lag.  Default value (10) retains old behavior.
- Climbing down ladders no longer makes a footstep sound every server frame (it sounded awful at higher sv_fps).
+ Added 'sync_guns' for sound timing with sv_fps: 0 plays shots immediately, 1 (default) syncs when multiple are firing, 2 delays all shot sounds to 10fps.
+ Added 'loud_guns' to make non-silenced shots heard from farther away.  Default 1 is on, set to 0 for classic sound attenuation.
+ New domination game mode (set 'dom 1') where teams claim flags by touching them and gain points for maintaining control.
+ Can combine use_3team with teamdm or dom mode.
- When not using maplist.ini, votes are now saved as action.ini-votes instead of maplist.ini-votes.  This fixes vote storage with 'ininame' cvar.
+ Added 'empty_rotate' to rotate maps when empty for that many minutes, to prevent being stuck on an unpopular map.  Default 0 means disabled.
+ Added 'empty_exec' to optionally execute config with empty_rotate.  Useful to revert to default settings on servers with configvote.
+ Enhanced Stealth Slippers addition (set 'e_enhancedSlippers 1')
+ Added 'tourney_lca' server cvar to enable "Lights Camera Action" at the beginning of the round rather than silence.  Set to 0 for classic use, 1 for LCA.
* Missing action.ini file no longer kills the server, it will default to CTF team names and skins (blue/red/green).  The presence of action.ini will still take precedence
+ Ability to change team names and skins during teamplay with sv t[i]name, sv t[i]skin and sv t[i]skin_index where i is the team number.
+ Added server cvar "sv_antilag" enables lag-compensation for aiming with hitscan weapons, useful for making high ping games more fair. (Default 1)
+ Added server cvar "sv_antilag_interp" accounts for interpolation with antilag, can cause players to be "shot around corners" even on low ping, but you can aim straight on the model. (Default 0)
+ Added server cvar "sv_limp_highping" players above this ping threshold will have movement prediction disabled with leg damage to make things less jittery. (Default 70)
+ Added userinfo Cvar "limp_nopred" clients can set this to force on or off movement prediction when taking leg damage. Legacy behavior would be "setu limp_nopred 0". (Default is decided by sv_limp_highping)
+ Exposed standing viewheight and crouched viewheight to the engine for compatible servers/clients to take advantage for use in crouch prediction.
+ Added bot support.  Use 'sv addbot' to spawn them on demand, or 'botdata.cfg' to spawn them every map.
* Bots branch no longer messes up multiplayer view models (player_state_t was not the expected size).
- Tweaked bot aiming so they're not such ridiculous crack shots in certain circumstances.
- Bots are no longer counted in voting, and you can kickvote bots with any number of players (minimum is ignored).
+ Added optional gender to 'botdata.cfg' parsing.
* Bot-safe printf functions no longer parse an extra level of "%".
+ Added 'ltk_botfile', set this string to the filename in the bots directory that you want to load bots from (example: 'supertroopers' to load bots/supertroopers.cfg).  Default string is 'botdata' to maintain backwards compatability
+ Added 'ltk_loadbots', set to "0" to stop bots from automatically loading from 'ltk_botfile', set to "1" for normal behavior.  This does not affect sv addbot/sv removebot
